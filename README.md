- Current work in progress as a base webpack config file to mimic a similar build process to one we have currently. 

Currently does the following:
    - Sass compilation + Post CSS autoprefixer
    - Babel ES6 conversion
    - hot-reload CSS (haven't tested how robust JS hot reload is)
    - It's fundamentally just a webpack config file
